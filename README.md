# ATOM

**ATOM** is a modern programming language that not only embraces the art of concise code but also strives to be an exceptionally practical language in the realm of everyday programming. Unlike the run-of-the-mill code golf languages, ATOM goes above and beyond, extending its capabilities to even run web servers. Building upon JavaScript's prowess in inferred type casting, ATOM elevates it to unimaginable heights by preemptively understanding the user's deepest intentions.

Forget about convoluted string splitting operations – in ATOM, it's as effortless as performing a division. Need to add a number to a null type? No problemo! ATOM will graciously cast that null to a 0 and hand back your precious original number. Convenience? Oh, ATOM has mastered it to perfection.

And hold your breath, because if you're already acquainted with the sheer brilliance of JavaScript, ATOM will make you feel right at home. It's like finding a long-lost soulmate in the realm of programming languages.

To emphasize its modernity, ATOM wholeheartedly embraces the contemporary keyboard, providing programmers with unparalleled flexibility with its limitless possibilities. We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the emoji alphabet to unlock the full potential of this groundbreaking language.

## Usage

Presently, ATOM operates through a java interpreter. Executing a script is a breeze – just sprinkle the following line of code anywhere in your project:

```
ATOMRuntime.processInput("1+1");
```

Feeling fancy and prefer to keep your program in a separate file? Fear not, for ATOM has you covered.

```
ATOMRuntime.processFile(new File("helloWorld.atom"));
```

## The Saga of ATOM

Once upon a time, an extraordinary software engineer roamed the lands. This engineer was a true embodiment of creativity, despising the notion of relying on other people's libraries. Naturally, there came a fateful day when a REST API's output needed parsing. JSON was the culprit. But instead of using Gson like any sane person would, our engineer embarked on a grand quest to forge their own JSON parser. Why, you ask? Simply because they could.

But the tale doesn't conclude there. This self-made JSON parser was then employed to decipher configuration files in a myriad of programs. However, something was amiss. Our protagonist loathed the absence of comments in JSON. They detested its inability to perform arithmetic operations. And oh, the agony of not being able to import sections of other JSONs! At this pivotal moment, a spark of unparalleled brilliance struck them. They dared to pose a question. What if JSON could achieve Turing completeness? What if JSON itself could metamorphose into a bona fide programming language?

Thus began the relentless transformation of the JSON parser into an abomination of unfathomable proportions. This unholy amalgamation boasted file imports, if statements, array mapping, string manipulation, and more. It was akin to Frankenstein's monster, a force to be reckoned with. Alas, it succumbed under the oppressive weight of its own existence, collapsing under the insurmountable burden of technical debt.

Years later, our resilient engineer, armed with newfound wisdom, decided to learn from their past missteps and set out to create a superior version from scratch. Something far beyond the confines of a mere fancy JSON parser. Behold, ATOM was born—a fully-fledged programming language that aspires to be the epitome of conciseness and perfection.
