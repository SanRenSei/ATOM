# ATOM

**ATOM** is a modern programming language that not only embraces the art of concise code but also can be used in the realm of everyday programming, including scripting, servers, web applications, data mining, and more.  It takes influences from a wide variety of successful languages including Javascript, SQL, Perl, and of course, APL.  ATOM, above all, strives to serve the niche of Mobile Application Development.

To optimize the Mobile Application Development experience, ATOM adheres to specific design principles that address the unique characteristics of mobile devices and how end users interact with them. Some key considerations include:

 - Device screen size: Mobile screens are relatively small, making it challenging to display large amounts of information.

 - Window switching: Unlike computer users who can easily switch between windows with Alt+Tab, mobile users face a more cumbersome process.

 - Keyboard differences: Mobile applications benefit from international and emoji keyboards, offering users greater flexibility in typing compared to traditional computer keyboards.

ATOM tackles these challenges through deliberate design choices. It employs conciseness to ensure more code can fit on the screen, rethinks how functions operate to reduce the need for developers to constantly switch between documentation pages, and supports emojis, enabling engineers to leverage the full potential of modern mobile keyboards.

As the first ever language specifically designed to allow engineers to comfortably write code from their phones, ATOM seeks to bring about a paradigm shift centered on Mobile Application Development.

## Usage

The easiest way to run ATOM code is through the web interpreter. Just go here, type your code, and run it! There may be some bugs, it is still a work in progress.

To run it offline, ATOM mainly uses a java interpreter. Pull the code, open the java project, and add the following line of code anywhere in your project:

```
ATOMRuntime.processInput("1+1");
```

Feeling fancy and prefer to keep your program in a separate file? Fear not, for ATOM has you covered.

```
ATOMRuntime.processFile(new File("helloWorld.atom"));
```

## The Saga of ATOM

In the realm of ancient times, when the world was filled with mysteries and enchantment, there lived a Fool. This Fool possessed an insatiable hunger for knowledge and a boundless imagination that danced like flames within his eyes. Driven by his audacity, the Fool embarked on a grand journey, determined to accomplish a feat that had eluded the minds of mortals for ages: the creation of a perfect language.

With a heart bursting with pride, the Fool traversed distant lands, forests, and rivers. His path was paved with ancient ruins and whispered tales of forgotten wisdom. Along this arduous journey, the Fool encountered 21 individuals, each embodying the essence of a card from the sacred Tarot's Major Arcana.

The first character the Fool met was the Magician, a charismatic figure who wielded the powers of transformation. "In language, find the alchemy that unites the mundane and the divine," the Magician advised, but the Fool dismissed it as mere sorcery.

Next, the Fool stumbled upon the High Priestess, an ethereal guardian of secrets. "The language you seek resides in the depths of intuition," she whispered. The Fool scoffed at her mystical notions, desiring a language built on logic alone.

As the Fool continued his odyssey, he encountered the Empress, a nurturing force of nature. "Language flourishes when it embraces the beauty of the world," she imparted. But the Fool deemed such sentiments irrelevant to the precision he sought.

In his wanderings, the Fool encountered the Emperor, a figure of authority and order. "A language must be structured, for chaos gives birth to confusion," the Emperor proclaimed. Yet the Fool rejected this advice, believing his language to be above the constraints of governance.

Along his winding path, the Fool met the Hierophant, an interpreter of sacred knowledge. "Seek wisdom from the ancient texts and let them guide your words," the Hierophant advised. But the Fool dismissed the past as a mere stepping stone on his path to the future.

The Lovers, radiant in their unity, whispered of the harmony that language could bring. "In the connections between words, you shall find the strength to bind hearts and souls," they shared. The Fool, absorbed in his own arrogance, brushed off their tender counsel.

The Fool's journey continued, and he encountered the Chariot, urging him to conquer his inner demons and harness his willpower. "Language should empower, not enslave," the Chariot exclaimed. The Fool, consumed by his own desires, paid no heed to this counsel.

Next, the Fool met the Strength card, representing the fierce fortitude of the soul. "To create a language, you must first conquer yourself," it proclaimed. But the Fool, blinded by his own ambition, saw no need for such introspection.

The Hermit, dwelling in solitude, spoke of inner reflection and self-discovery. "A language shaped by inner enlightenment can illuminate the minds of others," the Hermit shared. The Fool, lost in his own grandeur, dismissed the Hermit's words as mere ramblings.

The Wheel of Fortune, ever-turning, advised the Fool on the impermanence of language. "Language evolves as the world turns. Embrace change or be left behind," it warned. But the Fool, convinced of his infallibility, disregarded this message of adaptation.

As the Fool pressed on, he encountered Justice, an embodiment of balance and fairness. "A language must treat all with equity, lest it be tainted by prejudice," Justice declared. The Fool, convinced of his own righteousness, waved away this plea for equality.

The Hanged Man, suspended in a state of surrender, shared the wisdom of perspective. "Language should challenge the mind, upending preconceived notions," it imparted. The Fool, anchored in his own dogma, rejected this plea for open-mindedness.

The Fool's journey brought him to Death, a harbinger of transformation. "Language is born anew when old words find their final rest," Death intoned. But the Fool, clinging to his creations, shunned the concept of linguistic evolution.

The Fool met Temperance, a figure balancing opposing forces. "Language thrives when harmony reigns, merging opposites into one," Temperance whispered. The Fool, entangled in his own stubbornness, dismissed this call for equilibrium.

The Devil, embodiment of earthly desires, tempted the Fool with the allure of manipulation. "Language can be used as a weapon or a shield. Choose wisely," the Devil enticed. The Fool, lured by his own hubris, believed he had mastered the art of control.

In his travels, the Fool encountered the Tower, a symbol of destruction and rebirth. "Language can break down barriers or topple empires. Wield it with caution," the Tower warned. But the Fool, fueled by his own ego, ignored this plea for moderation.

The Star, a beacon of hope, spoke of inspiration and divine connection. "Language should inspire souls, guiding them to their highest potential," the Star proclaimed. The Fool, deafened by his own brilliance, dismissed this advice as unnecessary embellishment.

Next, the Fool met the Moon, a mistress of dreams and illusions. "Language can weave tales that blur reality and fantasy," the Moon whispered. The Fool, consumed by his own delusions, rejected the notion of poetic invention.

The Sun, radiating warmth and enlightenment, shared the power of simplicity. "Language shines brightest when it is accessible to all," the Sun declared. The Fool, entangled in his own complexity, disregarded this plea for clarity.

The Fool's penultimate encounter was with the Judgement card, calling for self-reflection and redemption. "Language should uplift and inspire, guiding humanity towards enlightenment," Judgement proclaimed. But the Fool, blind to his own flaws, saw no need for redemption.

Finally, the Fool stood before the last characterâ€”the World, representing completion and fulfillment. "In your quest for a perfect language, have you considered the beauty of imperfection?" the World inquired. But the Fool, intoxicated by his own grand design, believed himself invincible.

And so, after 21 encounters with wisdom and warnings, the Fool proudly unveiled his language to the world. It spread like wildfire, becoming the talk of scholars and scribes. The Fool, basking in the attention, believed that he had achieved his grand design. The streets echoed with discussions of his linguistic creation, and he reveled in the notion that people were conversing in his words.

Little did the Fool know that the world was not celebrating his masterpiece, but rather mocking it. The people, in their irony and jest, spoke his language with exaggerated gestures and theatrical voices, parodying its contrived structure and pompous vocabulary. They reveled in the absurdity, finding amusement in the Fool's misguided arrogance. Yet, oblivious to the truth, the Fool mistook laughter for admiration, deluding himself into believing that his language had captured the hearts of the masses.

And so, the Fool's journey came to an end, cloaked in a tragic irony. While his language was indeed well-known and spoken about, it was not for the reasons he envisioned. The Fool, blinded by his own conceit, could not fathom the derision that surrounded his creation. His legacy became a cautionary tale, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the folly of believing one's own brilliance. And as the world moved on, leaving the Fool and his language to fade into obscurity, the echoes of laughter served as a reminder that true understanding and connection can never be crafted through arrogance alone.
